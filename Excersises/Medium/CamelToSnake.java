/*
The company you are working for is refactoring its entire codebase. It's changing all naming conventions from camel to
snake case (camelCasing to snake_casing).
Every capital letter is replaced with its lowercase prefixed by an underscore _, except for the first letter, which is
lowercased without the underscore, so that SomeName becomes some_name.

Task:
Write a program that takes in a string that has camel casing, and outputs the same string but with snake casing.

Input Format:
A string with camelCasing.

Output Format:
The same string but with snake_casing.

Sample Input:
camelCasing

Sample Output:
camel_casing
